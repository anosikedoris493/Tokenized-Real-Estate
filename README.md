# Tokenized Real Estate Platform

A blockchain-based platform that enables real estate tokenization, fractional ownership, property management, and decentralized governance for real estate assets.

## System Architecture

The platform consists of four primary smart contracts that work together to create a comprehensive real estate tokenization and management solution:

### Property Tokenization Contract

Core contract responsible for tokenizing real estate assets:
- Mints ERC-721 tokens representing individual properties
- Stores property metadata and legal documentation
- Manages property valuation and token pricing
- Handles regulatory compliance and KYC/AML requirements
- Implements transfer restrictions based on legal requirements

### Fractional Ownership Contract

Manages partial ownership and dividend distribution:
- Creates ERC-20 tokens representing fractional property ownership
- Handles rental income distribution
- Manages dividend payments and profit sharing
- Implements liquidity pool mechanisms
- Tracks ownership percentages and transfer history

### Property Management Contract

Oversees day-to-day property operations:
- Manages maintenance requests and contractor payments
- Handles tenant relationships and rental agreements
- Tracks property expenses and income
- Maintains property documentation and reports
- Coordinates with off-chain property managers

### Voting Contract

Enables decentralized decision-making:
- Implements proposal creation and voting mechanisms
- Manages voting power based on ownership stake
- Handles vote delegation
- Executes approved proposals automatically
- Maintains proposal and voting history

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ethereum development environment (Hardhat/Truffle)
- Node.js 16+
- Solidity ^0.8.0
- IPFS node (for property documentation storage)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/tokenized-real-estate.git
cd tokenized-real-estate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Compile contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

## Usage Examples

### Tokenizing a Property

```solidity
function tokenizeProperty(
    string memory propertyAddress,
    uint256 propertyValue,
    uint256 totalShares,
    bytes memory legalDocumentation
) external returns (uint256 propertyId);
```

### Managing Fractional Ownership

```solidity
// Purchase property shares
function purchaseShares(
    uint256 propertyId,
    uint256 shareAmount
) external payable;

// Distribute dividends
function distributeDividends(
    uint256 propertyId
) external payable;
```

### Property Management

```solidity
// Submit maintenance request
function submitMaintenanceRequest(
    uint256 propertyId,
    string memory description,
    uint256 estimatedCost
) external returns (uint256 requestId);

// Update rental agreement
function updateRentalAgreement(
    uint256 propertyId,
    address tenant,
    uint256 rentalAmount,
    uint256 duration
) external;
```

### Governance

```solidity
// Create proposal
function createProposal(
    uint256 propertyId,
    string memory description,
    bytes memory executionData
) external returns (uint256 proposalId);

// Cast vote
function castVote(
    uint256 proposalId,
    bool support
) external;
```

## Security Considerations

### Legal Compliance
- Implement KYC/AML checks
- Ensure compliance with local real estate regulations
- Maintain proper documentation and audit trails
- Regular legal review of smart contracts

### Technical Security
- Access control mechanisms for different user roles
- Secure handling of funds and dividends
- Regular security audits
- Emergency pause functionality
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npx hardhat test

# Run specific test file
npx hardhat test test/PropertyTokenization.test.js
```

## Deployment

1. Configure network settings in `hardhat.config.js`
2. Deploy contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```
